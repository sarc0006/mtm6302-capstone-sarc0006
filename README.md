### Report
#### The overall web design consists of a halved red header background, the web brand and logo lying on the edge of the red header. There is a small text description below the logo, and a search and filter button below the description. Below that is a saved button for caught pokemons. There are 20 pokemons currently displayed, clickin on "more" will show adddtional 20 pokemon in a similar fashion. Each pokemon box displays a tiny photo of the pokemon, its numbering, and type. Clicking on it will display Ash with a text bubble, and a more detailed stats of the pokemon. You have the choice to "catch" the pokemon and keep it in a bookmark. Caught pokemon will display different texts on click. Although, not displayed in the mockup, caught pokemons have a yellow border surrounding the thumbnail.
#### Though displayed differently, the phone and tablet mockup have a similar design, with a few changes. The phone design does not display Ash when clicking on the pokemon; however, the tablet design shows Ash. Both the tablet and phone design have a bookmark icon instead of the "My Inventory" button that the website has.
