#### Capstone Project - Pokedex

### Report
#### The overall web design consists of a halved red header background, the web brand and logo lying on the edge of the red header. There is a small text description below the logo, and a search and filter button below the description. Below that is a saved button for caught pokemons. There are 20 pokemons currently displayed, clickin on "more" will show adddtional 20 pokemon in a similar fashion. Each pokemon box displays a tiny photo of the pokemon, its numbering, and type. Clicking on it will display Ash with a text bubble, and a more detailed stats of the pokemon. You have the choice to "catch" the pokemon and keep it in a bookmark. Caught pokemon will display different texts on click. Although, not displayed in the mockup, caught pokemons have a yellow border surrounding the thumbnail.
#### Though displayed differently, the phone and tablet mockup have a similar design, with a few changes. The phone design does not display Ash when clicking on the pokemon; however, the tablet design shows Ash. Both the tablet and phone design have a bookmark icon instead of the "My Inventory" button that the website has. 
#### The Steps taken in creation of the prototype: 
##### (1) Project Planning - using the mockup from last assignment, I created an almost similar look for the protype with HTML and CSS. I included the color schemes, alignment, and the general structure of the original mockup. 
##### (2) Research and Requirement Gathering - with that said, I then used resources such as w3schools and StackOverflow to help me acquire the knowledge needed to create the mockup. 
##### (3) Data Integration - Using PokeAPI to retrieve the pokemons, I created the script.js file in order to make the mockup functional. 
##### (4) Trial and Error (Testing) - Finally, with the HTML, CSS and Javascript files created, I proceeded to add more code, edit, and delete accordingly. 
#### Resources used: 
##### (1) PokeAPI
##### (2) HTML, CSS, and Javascript
##### (3) Visual Studio Code for editing
##### (4) Git and Github for version control
#### In conclusion, The development of the Pokedex prototype was a comprehensive process that involved planning, research, development, and testing. By utilizing the PokeAPI and various web development technologies, I've successfully created a semi-functional Pokedex. The challenges faced during the project were overcome with careful problem-solving and continuous improvement. This report serves as a summary of the steps taken and the resources used to create the Pokedex prototype.
